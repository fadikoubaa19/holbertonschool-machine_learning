  * what's <bold>qa bot</bold>:
  Question Answering (QA) Systems is an automated approach to retrieve correct responses to the questions asked by human in natural language. The fundamental thought behind QA system is to assist man-machine interaction.
  
  * My tasks:
  <br> 0-qa.py:
  <br> - it's a function that find the snippest of text within a reference document to answer a question.
  <br> 1-loop.py:
  - In this function i created a script by using a loop (while) that takes the question from the user from prompt and answer .
  <br> 2-qa:
   - in this task, based on ""1-loop.py"" i created  function that take the answers from a text.
  <br> 3-semantic_search:
  <br>- what's semantic_search? :
   <br>- semantic search   is a data searching, which a search query aims to not only find keywords

   <br>1- think about topics not ony the keywords.
   <br>2- match with content

   <br> based on 2-qa task , icreated a function that answers from many texts by using 
  
  <h2><center> Libraries: </center></h2>
  
  * In this project i used 3 libraries:
  <br>-Tenserflow: is an open source library made by google , that train models, serve prediction and refine future result.
  <br>-Tenserflow-hub: is a library that provide many pre-trained models like: words embedding and classifications.
  <br>-OS : a library that write and read files.
  <br>- BertTokenizr: is a library that break the words into fragements.
  <br>-Numpy: is open source library we use it to prefrom a mathematical operations on arrays
